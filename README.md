# UART, I2C and SPI
### UART: UART facilitates serial data transmission without the need for a clock signal, making it suitable for asynchronous communication between devices like computers and modems.

### I2C: I2C is a synchronous serial communication protocol enabling multiple devices to communicate over just two wires, featuring master-slave architecture and acknowledge bit confirmation.

### SPI: SPI offers full-duplex communication between a single master and multiple slaves using four wires, allowing continuous data transmission without start/stop bits but limited to single-master setups.
